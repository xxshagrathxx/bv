1- Using mysql import the initial script.
2- connection.php contains the connection string (must me modified)

This problem can be easily solved by mysql update statements because the `offers` table just contains 3 records, But considering a real life case it needs a better solution.

3- Made 2 Json files one for the right data, The other is for the corrupted data for testing purposes.
4- the program contains comments and it's self explanatory.
